\section{Experience}

\textbf{Bioinformatics Software Developer} \hfill \textbf{2012 - Present}\\
\href{http://depts.washington.edu/labweb/}{\textit{University of Washington Department of Laboratory Medicine}},
Seattle, Washington\\
 I am a bioinformatics developer of Python software packages and pipelines that parse and analyze molecular microbiology 
 next-gen sequencing data. My work has resulted in several publications. I have also helped expand our bioinformatics 
 software development team and mentor new bioinformatics engineers.

\textbf{Full Stack Software Engineer} \hfill \textbf{2009 - 2012}\\
\href{http://www.seattletimes.com/}{\textit{The Seattle Times Company}}, Seattle, Washington\\
 I developed digital content distribution software. My role required the flexibility to develop using the latest software 
 technologies on new and old platforms with minimal documentation. I had the pleasure of working alongside Pulitzer prize 
 winning journalists, photographers and videographers. My role aided the transition from print and legacy software 
 systems to cutting edge cloud based digital content management systems.

\textbf{Graduate Student} \hfill \textbf{2007 - 2009}\\
\href{https://www.soic.indiana.edu/}{\textit{Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing}}, Bloomington, Indiana\\
Thesis Project: Using genomics to map disease in coral reef ecosystems.

\textbf{Software Developer} \hfill \textbf{2005 - 2007}\\
\href{http://www.regenstrief.org/}{\textit{Regenstrief Institute}}, Indianapolis, Indiana\\
	I developed Java software applications to help doctors, pharmacists and physicians 
  prescribe medicine and manage patient records.

\textbf{Software Developer} \hfill \textbf{2003 - 2005}\\
\href{http://chem.indiana.edu/}{\textit{Indiana University Department of Chemistry}}, Bloomington, Indiana\\
  At the Chemistry department I developed a content management system for digital classroom homework assignments.
  The system was custom developed using Perl and Javascript without the availability of today's web based 
  software stack technologies.
