\section{Experience}

\textbf{Bioinformatics Software Engineer} \hfill \textbf{2012 - Present}\\
\href{http://depts.washington.edu/labweb/}{\textit{University of Washington Department of Laboratory Medicine}},
Seattle, Washington\\
I develop bioinformatics pipelines for molecular microbiology analysis. My work has resulted in several publications. I also help mentor new bioinformatics engineers and promote common software development practices to manage growing project demands and workflows.

\textbf{Full Stack Software Engineer} \hfill \textbf{2009 - 2012}\\
\href{http://www.seattletimes.com/}{\textit{The Seattle Times Company}}, Seattle, Washington\\
I developed and maintained digital content management systems. My role required the flexibility to develop new software while supporting minimally documented legacy systems. I had the pleasure of working alongside Pulitzer prize winning journalists, photographers and videographers.

\textbf{Graduate Student} \hfill \textbf{2007 - 2009}\\
\href{https://www.soic.indiana.edu/}{\textit{Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing}}, Bloomington, Indiana\\
 Thesis Project: Coral Reef Ecosystem Gene Ontologies

\textbf{Software Development Engineer} \hfill \textbf{2005 - 2007}\\
\href{http://www.regenstrief.org/}{\textit{Regenstrief Institute}}, Indianapolis, Indiana\\
At Regenstrief I developed Java software applications to help doctors, pharmacists and physicians prescribe medicine and manage patient records.

\textbf{Software Development Engineer} \hfill \textbf{2003 - 2005}\\
\href{http://chem.indiana.edu/}{\textit{Indiana University Department of Chemistry}}, Bloomington, Indiana\\
At Chemistry I developed a content management system for digital classroom homework assignments. The system was built from scratch using Perl and Javascript without the availability of todayâ€™s web based software stack technologies.
